Find eclipsing binaries and variable stars in TESS light curve data

A 2D histogram is generated of the lightcurve along time and flux directions the shift of the mode of the flux in time is compared to a limit value.

If the number of peaks is between nlim and plim the light curve may contain an eclipsing binary or a variable star.
